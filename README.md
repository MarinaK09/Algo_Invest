# Algo_Invest

Programming two algorithms in python to solve a problem.

These algorithms suggest the most profitable stocks that we should buy from a list of stocks to maximize profit after two years of investing. These stocks lists are in the csv files. There is a maximum amount to invest. bruteforce.py can be tested with dataset3 et optimized.py with dataset1 and dataset2. If bruteforce.py is tested with dataset1 or dataset2 it will take a long time to run.

1.	Create a virtual environment : python -m venv env
2.	Activate the virtual environment: source env/bin/activate
3.	Run bruteforce.py or optimized.py
